# Python Learning & Automation Projects

This repository showcases my progress in Python development, focusing on clean code, OOP principles, and practical automation tools.

## Projects

### 1. OOP Engineering Calculator
A command-line tool that demonstrates:
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Use of inheritance and class structures.
* **Error Handling:** Robust validation of user input (handling division by zero and non-numeric data).
* **Standard Libraries:** Integration with the `math` module.
* **History Management:** Tracking session operations within a class.

**How to run:**
